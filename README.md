# phyddle

A repository for fiddling around with Phylogenetic Deep Learning.

Python pipeline scripts for using CNNs + deep learning to estimate SSE model parameters.

The repository has five main directories:
- `code` contains scripts to generate and process data
- `raw_data` contains raw data generated by simulation
- `tensor_data` contains data formatted into tensors for training networks
- `network` contains trained networks and diagnostics
- `plot` contains figures of training and validation procedures

In general, the pipeline assumes that the user supplies runs scripts in `code` using a consistent *project name* (e.g. `my_project`) to coordinate the analysis across the `raw_data`, `tensor_data`, `network`, and `plot` directories.
