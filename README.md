# phyddle

A pipeline-based toolkit for fiddling around with phylogenetic models and deep learning 

*NOTE:*

* **This private beta version of phyddle is still under development.** Although it's tested and stable, much of the documentation and some key features are still missing. Most phyddle development occurs on a 64-core Ubuntu server and a 16-core Intel Macbook Pro laptop, so there are also unknown portability/scalability issues to correct. Any feedback is appreciated! michael.landis@wustl.edu*



## Overview

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/landislab/landislab.github.io/blob/5bb4685a12ebf4c99dd773de6d87b44cc3c47090/assets/research/img/phyddle_pipeline.png?raw=true" width="35%">

A standard phyddle analysis performs the following tasks for you:

- **Pipeline configuration** applies analysis settings provided through a config file and/or command line arguments.
- **Model configuration** constructs a base simulating model to be *Simulated* (states, events, rates).
- **Simulating** simulates a large training dataset under the model to be *Formatted* (parallelized, partly compressed). Saves output in the [`raw_data`](raw_data) directory.
- **Formatting** encodes the raw simulated data into tensor format for *Learning* (parallelized, compressed). Saves output in the [`tensor_data`](tensor_data) directory.
- **Learning** shuffles and splits training data, builds a network, then trains and saves the network with the data for *Prediction*. Saves output in the [`network`](network) directory.
- **Predicting** estimates model parameters for a new dataset with the trained network. Saves output in the [`predict`](predict) directory.
- **Plotting** generates figures that summarize the training data (*Formatting*), the network and its training (*Learning*), and any new predictions (*Predicting*). Saves output in the [`plot`](plot) directory.



## Quick start

To run a phyddle analysis enter the `code` directory:
```shell
cd ~/projects/phyddle/code
```

Then create and run a pipeline under the settings you've specified in `my_config.py`:
```shell
./run_pipeline.sh --cfg my_config
```

This will run a phyddle analysis for a simple 3-region GeoSSE model with just 500 training examples. In practice, you'll want to generate a larger training dataset with anywhere from 10k to 1M examples, depending on the model.

To add new examples to your training set
```shell
# simulate new training examples and store in raw_data/my_project
./run_simulate.sh --cfg my_config --start_idx 500 --end_idx 15000

# encode all raw_data examples as tensors in tensor_data/my_project
./run_format.sh --cfg my_config --start_idx 0 --end_idx 15000

# train network with tensor_data, but override batch size, then store in network/my_project
./run_learn.sh --cfg my_config --batch_size 256

# make prediction with example dataset
./run_predict.sh --cfg my_config

# generate figures and store in plot
./run_plot.sh --cfg my_config
```

Pipeline options are applied to all pipeline stages. See the full list of currently supported options with
```shell
./run_pipeline.sh --help
```


## Features

Current features:
- trained network generates parameter estimates and coverage-calibrated prediction intervals (CPIs) for input datasets
- provides several state-dependent birth-death model types and variants (more to come)
- parallelized simulating, formatting, and learning
- encoding of phylogenetic-state tensor from serial and extant-only input with multiple states (CBLV+S and CDV+S extensions)
- encoding of auxiliary data tensor from automatically computed summary statistics and "known" parameter (e.g. sampling rate)
- HDF5 with gzip compression for tensor data
- shuffles and splits input tensors into training, test, validation, and calibration datasets for supervised learning
- builds network with convolution, pooling, and dense layers that match input tensors

- expansion of unit/integration testing



## Installation & Requirements

To install phyddle on your computer, you can either clone the repository or you can [download](https://github.com/mlandis/phyddle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the current version of the main branch.

phyddle was last tested using with Mac OS X 11.6.4 (Intel CPU) using Python 3.11.3 (installed with homebrew) with the following versions of the required third-party package dependencies (installed with pip):
```
PIL 9.5.0
PyPDF2 3.0.1
argparse 1.1
h5py 3.8.0
joblib 1.2.0
keras 2.12.0
matplotlib 3.7.1
numpy 1.23.5
pandas 2.0.0
pydot_ng 2.0.0
scipy 1.10.1
sklearn 1.2.2
tensorflow 2.12.0
tqdm 4.65.0
```

phyddle is also used with a 64-core Ubuntu LTS 22.04 server using Python 3.xx.xx (aptitude) and similar package versions. phyddle has yet not been tested using conda, Windows, M1 Macs, various GPUs, etc.

phyddle currently relies on the BEAST plugin MASTER for simulation. The operating system must be able to call BEAST from anywhere in the filesystem through the `beast` command. This can be done by adding the BEAST executable to be covered by the `$PATH` shell variable. Creating a symbolic link (shortcut) to the BEAST binary `beast` with `ln -s` in `~/.local/bin` is one an easy way to make `beast` globally accessible on Mac OS X.
```
$ ls -lart /Users/mlandis/.local/bin/beast
lrwxr-xr-x  1 mlandis  staff  35 Feb 14 10:32 /Users/mlandis/.local/bin/beast -> /Applications/BEAST 2.7.3/bin/beast
$  which beast
/Users/mlandis/.local/bin/beast
$ beast -version                                                                                                       1 â†µ

```

## Developer guide
(to be written)

We will host documentation built with `sphinx` to help developers read, use, and modify the back-end Python source code for their purposes. For now, anyone who clones the repository can make local changes to the code, though with some risk of introducing errors to how the tested version of phyddle behaves.


## User guide
(under development)

This guide provides phyddle users with an overview for how the toolkit works, how to configure it, where it stores files, and how to interpret files and figures.

In general, the pipeline assumes that the user supplies runs scripts in `code` using a consistent *project name* (e.g. `my_project`) to coordinate the analysis across the `raw_data`, `tensor_data`, `network`, and `plot` directories.

### Example dataset

The `example` project bundled with phyddle was generated using the command `./code/run_pipeline.sh --cfg config --proj example --end_idx 25000`. This corresponds to a 3-region equal-rates GeoSSE model. All directories are populated, except `raw_data/example` contains only 20 original examples.

### Directory structure

The repository has five main directories:
- [`code`](code) contains scripts to generate and process data
- [`raw_data`](raw_data) contains raw data generated by simulation
- [`tensor_data`](tensor_data) contains data formatted into tensors for training networks
- [`network`](network) contains trained networks and diagnostics
- [`predict`](predict) contains new test datasets their predictions
- [`plot`](plot) contains figures of training and validation procedures

If a user runs an analysis with the project name `my_project`, then pipeline files created by the analysis would be stored in the following directories
```
raw_data/my_project       # output of Simulating
tensor_data/my_project    # output of Formatting
network/my_project        # output of Learning
predict/my_project        # output of Predicting
plot/my_project           # output of Plotting
```

### Analysis configuration

There are two ways to configure a phyddle analysis: through the config file or (when run via command line) command line options. Settings a config file are overwritten by any provided command line options. Both input systems use the same names for the same settings. All required analysis settings must be provided by config file and command line options, together, for a phyddle analysis to run successfully.

## Config file

The config file is a Python dictionary that specifies various program settings (arguments or `args`) that configure how the underlying pipeline steps behave. Because it's a Python script, you can write code within the config file to specify your analysis, if you find that helpful. The below example defines settings into different blocks based on which pipeline step first needs a given setting. However, any setting might be used by different pipeline steps, so we concatenate all settings into a single dictionary called `args`, which is then used by all pipeline steps.

**NOTE: phyddle assumes you want to use the config file calle `my_config.py`. Use a different config file by calling, e.g. `./run_pipline --cfg my_other_config.py`**

### Command line arguments

Settings applied through the config file can be overwritten by setting options when running phyddle from the command line. The names of settings are the same for the command line options and in the config file. Using command line options makes it easy to adjust the behavior of pipeline steps without needing to edit the config file. List all settings that can be adjusted with the command line using the `--help` option:

### Model configuration

(in progress)

Models in phyddle are designed by setting five control variables: `model_type`, `model_variant`, `num_char`, `rv_fn`, `rv_arg`.

Defining a model is only needed if you use phyddle to simulate training data through the Simulating step. The Simulating step describes the format phyddle expects for training datasets.

At a high level, `model_type` defines a class of models that share similar statespaces and eventspaces. The `model_variant` defines how rates are assigned to distinct event patterns in the eventspace. The behavior of how characters evolve and how character states influence other evolutionary dynamics are internally determined by `model_type` and `model_variant`. The number of distinct character supported by the model is set by `num_char`. Lastly, the way base parameter values are drawn for each simulated example in the training dataset are controlled with a set of random variable functions (`rv_fn`) and random variable arguments (`rv_arg`). Both `rv_fn` and `rv_arg` are dictionaries with keys that correspond to event class labels. With `rv_fn` the values are data-generating functions that have arguments and behavior equivalent to `scipy.stats.distribution.rvs`. With `rv_arg` the values are the arguments passed in to the corresponding `rv_fn` functions.

Descriptions of supported built-in models that you can specify with `model_type` and `model_variant` are listed using the `--show_models`. (More models to come. Developer guide will describe how to add new model types [harder] and variants [easier].)

```shell
$ ./run_simulate.py --show_models                             130 â†µ
Type                Variant             Description
============================================================
geosse              --                  Geographic State-dependent Speciation Extinction [GeoSSE]
                    free_rates          rates differ among all events within type
                    equal_rates         rates equal among all events within type
                    density_effect      equal_rates + local density-dependent extinction

sirm                --                  Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Migration [SIRM]
                    free_rates          rates differ among all events within type
                    equal_rates         rates equal among all events within type
```

Let's create a geographic state-dependent speciation-extinction (GeoSSE) model as a concrete example. GeoSSE models describe how species move and evolve among discrete regions through four event classes: within-region speciation, between-region speciation, dispersal, and local extinction. We'll create a GeoSSE model for a biogeographic system with three regions where all events within a class have equal rates, where rates are exponentially distributed with expected values of 1.0. The settings in the configuration file for this would be

```python
`model_type`     : `geosse`,
`model_variant`  : `equal_rates`,
`num_char`       : 3,
`rv_fn`          : {
    	`w` : sp.stats.expon.rvs,
    	`b` : sp.stats.expon.rvs,
    	`d` : sp.stats.expon.rvs,
    	`e` : sp.stats.expon.rvs
	},
`rv_arg`         : {
    	`w` : { `scale` : 1.0 },
    	`b` : { `scale` : 1.0 },
    	`d` : { `scale` : 1.0 },
    	`e` : { `scale` : 1.0 }
	}

```


### Simulating

(to be written)

Once your model is configured, you can instruct phyddle to simulate your training dataset. Currently, phyddle relies on the MASTER plugin from BEAST to simulate. MASTER was designed primarily to simulate under Susceptible-Infected-Recovered compartment models from epidemiology. These models allow for lineage to evolve according to rates that depend on the state of the entire evolutionary system. For example, the rate of change for one species may depend on its state and the number of other species in that state or other states. See the Requirements section to see how phyddle expects MASTER and BEAST are configured for its use.

Results from simulations are stored based on the `sim_dir` and `proj` settings. `sim_dir` is the directory in phyddle that contains the "raw" simulated output across all projects, and is typically set to `raw_data`. `proj` defines the simulations for a single project. Each individual simulation is assigned a replicate index. You can simulate replicates in different "chunks" with the start (`start_idx`) and end (`end_idx`) index variables, which is especially useful for building up a training dataset for a project over multiple jobs, e.g. on a cluster.

Each replicate being simulated will run for some length of evolutionary time (`stop_time`) and may require some minimum (`min_num_taxa`) and/or maximum (`max_num_taxa`) number of lineages per simulation.

Assuming that `sim_dir == raw_data` and `proj == example`, the standard simulation output will follow this format
```
raw_data/example/sim.0.tre
raw_data/example/sim.0.dat.nex
raw_data/example/sim.0.param_col.csv
raw_data/example/sim.0.param_row.csv
```


The `.tre` file contains a Newick string. The `.dat.nex` contains a Nexus character matrix. These are reformatted as tensors to become the input training dataset. The `.param_col.csv` and `.param_row.csv` contain the simulating parameters in column and row format, with the row format files being converted to a tensor of training labels. 

In addition, MASTER will retain only the certain simulated taxa (populations) from the system, set using `sample_population`. phyddle generates an `xml` file that specifies the MASTER simulation, a `beast.log` file that reports the text generated by BEAST during simulation, and a `json` file that reports metadata about the evolutionary history of the system. These files can be valuable for debugging and postprocessing, but they may become quite large, so the `sim_logging` setting will control whether they are retained, compressed, or deleted.


Note, that downstream steps in the pipeline, such as Formatting, only require that the appropriate files with the appropriate content exist to proceed. They can either be generated with the Simuating step within phyddle or completely outside of phyddle.

### Formatting


Raw simulated data must first boverted into a tensor format to interface with the neural network we'll later train and use for future predictions. For most computational purposes, it is safe to think of a tensor as an n-dimensional array. It is essential that all individual datasets share a standard shape (e.g. numbers of rows and columns) to ensure the training dataset that contains predictable data patterns. phyddle formatting encodes two input tensors and one output tensor.

One input tensor is the phylogenetic-data tensor. The phylogenetic-state tensors used by phyddle are based on the compact bijective ladderized vector (CBLV) format of Voznica et al. (2022). CBLV encodes a phylogenetic tree with N taxa in to a vector of length 2N that contains branch length and topological information for a tree with taxa serially sampled over time (e.g. epidemiological data). Another important tensor type developed by Lambert et al. (2022) is the compact diversified vector (CDV). CDV is also of length 2N but with one row corresponding to node ages and the other recording state values for a single binary character.

## About
Thanks for your interest in phyddle. The phyddle project emerged from a phylogenetic deep learning study led by Ammon Thompson ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.08.527714v2)). The goal of phyddle is to provide its users with a generalizable pipeline workflow for phylogenetic modeling and deep learning. This hopefully will make it easier for phylogenetic model enthusiasts and developers to explore and apply models that do not have tractable likelihood functions. It's also intended for use by methods developers who want to characterize how deep learning methods perform under different conditions for standard phylogenetic estimation tasks.

The phyddle project is developed by [Michael Landis](https://landislab.org) and [Ammon Thompson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_EpmmTwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
