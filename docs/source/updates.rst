**phyddle v0.0.6** -- 23.08.09

  * Refreshed documentation, plus added setting tables and glossary.
  * Centralize management of settings.
  * Settings now automatically apply default config, then user config, then command line arguments.
  * Format only enodes for a single tree width category now.
  * Format now downsamples and stores raw num. taxa for each data point.
  * Allow for "all-but-X" CPUs for multiprocessing.
  * Simulate wth --sim_more option to add new replicates to training examples.
  * Format encodes all detected datasets by default.
  * Support to allow scripts to simulate batches (>1) of replicates.
  * Major overhaul of help docs, but not done.

**phyddle v0.0.5** -- 23.07.30

  * Pipeline steps renamed to: Simulate, Format, Train, Estimate, Plot
  * Simulators now in scripts/sim/MASTER, scripts/sim/R, scripts/sim/Rev
  * Streamlined handling of phyddle settings, internally
  * Model configuration code moved outside phyddle
  * MASTER simulator now outside phyddle, in scripts/sim/MASTER
  * Complete source code reorg/rename
  * Pipeline script now prints pipeline steps
  * Support for granular management of flow of projects across pipeline steps
  * Support asymmetric CPI calibration
  * Better handling of FileNotFoundError related to Estimate step
  * Much faster Formatting step (>100x speedup)
  * Pipeline steps now generate logs in ``workspace/log/<project_name>`` to track phyddle is used during a project analysis
  * Tested against Apple M1. Not an easy install, because unsupported by Tensorflow. Thanks Albert and Sean!


**phyddle v0.0.4** -- 23.07.09

  * Simulating now supports command-line scripts
  * Better backend support for alternative phylostate tensor encodings
  * Simplified pipeline scripts and interface
  * Docs improved to reflect current code design
  * Tests now cover Simulating and Formatting


**phyddle v0.0.3** -- 23.07.02

  * Sphinx configuration for documentation
  * TestPyPI configuration for package deployment
  * GitHub Actions configuration for unit testing


**phyddle v0.0.2** -- 23.06.25

  * (first internal working version)
  * trained network generates parameter estimates and coverage-calibrated prediction intervals (CPIs) for input datasets
  * provides several state-dependent birth-death model types and variants (more to come)
  * parallelized simulating, formatting, and learning
  * encoding of phylogenetic-state tensor from serial and extant-only input with multiple states (CBLV+S and CDV+S extensions)
  * encoding of auxiliary data tensor from automatically computed summary statistics and "known" parameter (e.g. sampling rate)
  * HDF5 with gzip compression for tensor data
  * shuffles and splits input tensors into training, test, validation, and calibration datasets for supervised learning
  * builds network with convolution, pooling, and dense layers that match input tensors
  * trains network and saves history
  * automatic figure generation with Matplotlib


**phyddle v0.0.1** -- 23.03.16

  * (initial development version)
