Workspace
=========

This section describes how phyddle organizes files and directories in its
workspace. Visit :ref:`Formats` to learn more about file formats. Visit
:ref:`Configuration` to learn more about managing directories and projects
within a workspace.

The configuration for a phyddle analysis determines where pipeline step results
are saved. For example, results from the simulation step are stored in the
`sim_dir` directory. The default phyddle config file assumes that simulate
step results are saved to `./workspace/my_project/simulate`. We recommend
using a similar directory structure for new projects to simplify project 
management.   

Under the default configuration file, phyddle saves work from its pipeline
steps to the location ``./workspace/my_project`` directory. Briefly, the
``workspace`` directory itself contains six subdirectories corresponding to
the five pipeline steps, plus one directory for logs:

* ``simulate`` contains raw data generated by simulation
* ``format`` contains data formatted into tensors for training networks
* ``train`` contains trained networks and diagnostics
* ``estimate`` contains new test datasets their estimateions
* ``plot`` contains figures of training and validation procedures
* ``log`` contains runtime logs for a phyddle project

This section will assume all steps are using the ``example`` project
bundled with phyddle was generated using the command ``phyddle --make_cfg``.

.. code-block::

    ./scripts/run_phyddle.sh --cfg Rev_config.py --end_idx 25000
    
This corresponds to a 3-region equal-rates GeoSSE model. All directories have
the complete file set, except ``./workspace/example/simulate`` contains only
20 original examples.

A standard configuration for a project named ``example`` would store pipeline
work into these directories:

.. code-block:: shell

	workspace/example/simulate       # output of Simulate step
	workspace/example/format         # output of Format step
	workspace/example/train          # output of Train step
	workspace/example/estimate       # output of Estimate step
	workspace/example/plot           # output of Plot step
	workspace/example/log            # analysis logs

Next, we give an overview of the standard files and formats corresponding to
each pipeline directory.


``simulate``
------------

The :ref:`Simulate` step generates raw data from a simulating model that cannot
yet be fed to the neural network for training. A typical simulation will
produce the following files

.. code-block:: shell

    workspace/example/simulate/sim.0.tre              # tree file
    workspace/example/simulate/sim.0.dat.csv          # data file
    workspace/example/simulate/sim.0.labels.csv       # data-generating params

Each tree file contains a simple Newick string. Each data file contains state
data either in Nexus format (`.dat.nex`) or simple comma-separated value format
(`.dat.csv`) depending on the setting for ``char_format``.

``format``
----------

Applying :ref:`Format` to a directory of simulated datasets will output
tensors containing the entire set of training examples, stored to, e.g.
``workspace/example/format``. What formatted files are created depends on
the value of ``tensor_format`` and ``tree_width``.

When ``tree_width`` is set to ``200``, :ref:`Format` will yield two simulated
dataset tensors: one for the training examples and another for the test
examples.

If the ``tensor_format`` setting is ``'csv'`` (Comma-Separated Value, or CSV
format), the formatted files are:

.. code-block:: shell
    
    test.nt200.phy_data.csv
    test.nt200.aux_data.csv
    test.nt200.labels.csv
    train.nt200.phy_data.csv
    train.nt200.aux_data.csv
    train.nt200.labels.csv

where the `phy_data.csv` files contain one flattened Compact Phylogenetic Vector +
States (CPV+S) entry per row, the `aux_data.csv` files contain one vector of
auxiliary data (summary statistics and known parameters) values per row, and
`labels.csv` contains one vector of label (estimated parameters) per row. Each
row for each of the CSV files will correspond to a single, matched simulated
training example. All files are stored in standard comma-separated value
format, making them easily read by standard CSV-reading functions.

If the ``tensor_format`` setting is ``'hdf5'``, the resulting files are:

.. code-block:: shell
    
    test.nt200.hdf5
    train.nt200.hdf5

where each HDF5 file contains all phylogenetic-state (CPV+S) data, auxiliary
data, and label data. Individual simulated training examples share the same
set of ordered examples across three iternal datasets stored in the file. HDF5
format is not as easily readable as CSV format. However, phyddle uses gzip
to automatically (de)compress records, which often leads to files that are
over twenty times smaller than equivalent uncompressed CSV formatted tensors.


``train``
---------

Training a network creates the following files in the ``workspace/example/train``
directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    network_nt500.cpi_adjustments.csv
    network_nt500.train_aux_data_norm.csv
    network_nt500.train_est.labels.csv
    network_nt500.train_history.csv
    network_nt500.train_label_est_nocalib.csv
    network_nt500.train_label_norm.csv
    network_nt500.train_true.labels.csv
    network_nt500.trained_model.pkl

The prefix ``network_nt500`` indicates the results are appropriate for tensors
with tree width of 500. Descriptions of the files are as follows, with the prefix omitted for brevity:
* ``network_nt500.trained_model.pkl``: a saved file containing the trained PyTorch model
* ``train_label_norm.csv`` and ``train_aux_data_norm.csv``: the location-scale values from the training dataset to (de)normalize the labels and auxiliary data from any dataset
* ``train_true.labels.csv``: the true values of labels for the training and test datasets, where columns correspond to estimated labels (e.g. model parameters)
* ``train_est.labels.csv``: the trained network estimates of labels for the training and test datasets, with calibrated prediction intervals, where columns correspond to point estimates and estimates for lower CPI and upper CPI bounds for each named label (e.g. model parameter)
* ``train_label_est_nocalib.csv``: the trained network estimates of labels for the training and test datasets, with uncalibrated prediction intervals
* ``train_history.csv``: the metrics across training epochs monitored during network training
* ``cpi_adjustments.csv``: calibrated prediction interval adjustments, where columns correspond to parameters, the first row contains lower bound adjustments, and the second row contains upper bound adjustments


``estimate``
------------

The :ref:`Estimate` step will both read new (biological) datasets from the
project directory, and save new intermediate files, and store outputted
estimates in the same directory, located at e.g. 
``workspace/example/estimate``:

.. code-block:: shell

    new.0.tre                   # input:             initial tree
    new.0.dat.csv               # input:             character data
    new.0.labels.csv            # input:             contains known parameters (optional)
    new.0.extant.tre            # intermediate:      pruned tree                                
    new.0.phy_data.csv          # intermediate:      CPV+S tensor data 
    new.0.aux_data.csv          # intermediate:      aux. data tensor data 
    new.0.info.csv              # intermediate:      formatting info
    new.0.emp_est_labels.csv    # output:            empirical label estimates for new.0
    new.0.test_est.labels.csv   # output:            label estimates for test simulations
    new.0.test_true.labels.csv  # output:            true label values for test simulations

All files have previously been explained in the ``simulate``, ``format``,
or ``train`` workspace sections, except for two.

The ``labels.csv`` file is optional, and is used to provide "known"
data-generating parameter values to the network for training, as part of the
auxiliary dataset. If provided, it contains a row of names for known parameters
followed by a row of respective values. Only parameters that match entries in
the ``param_data`` setting are used.

The ``emp_est_labels.csv`` file reports the point estimates and lower and upper
CPI estimates for all targetted parameters. Estimates for parameters appear
across columns, where columns are grouped first by label (e.g. parameter) and
then statistic (e.g. value, lower-bound, upper-bound). For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cat new.1.sim_batchsize128_numepoch20_nt500.est_labels.csv
   w_0_value,w_0_lower,w_0_upper,e_0_value,e_0_lower,e_0_upper,d_0_1_value,d_0_1_lower,d_0_1_upper,b_0_1_value,b_0_1_lower,b_0_1_upper
   0.2867125345651129,0.1937433853918723,0.45733220552078013,0.02445545359384659,0.002880695707341881,0.10404499205878459,0.4502031713887769,0.1966340488593367,0.5147956690178682,0.06199703190510973,0.0015074254823161301,0.27544015163806645


The `test_est.labels.csv` and `test_true.labels.csv` files contain estimated
and true label values for the simulated test dataset that were left aside
during training.
