User guide
==========

This guide provides phyddle users with an overview for how the toolkit works, how to configure it, where it stores files, and how to interpret files and figures.

In general, the pipeline assumes that the user supplies runs scripts in ``scripts`` using a consistent *project name* (e.g. ``my_project``) to coordinate the analysis across the ``raw_data``, ``tensor_data``, ``network``, and ``plot`` directories.


.. _project_layout:

Project layout
--------------

By default, phyddle saves work from its pipeline steps to the ``workspace`` directory. The ``workspace`` directory itself contains five subdirectories that correspond to the different pipeline steps:

* ``raw_data`` contains raw data generated by simulation
* ``tensor_data`` contains data formatted into tensors for training networks
* ``network`` contains trained networks and diagnostics
* ``predict`` contains new test datasets their predictions
* ``plot`` contains figures of training and validation procedures

If a user runs an analysis with the project name ``my_project``, then pipeline files created by the analysis would be stored in the following directories

.. code-block:: shell

	workspace/raw_data/my_project       # output of Simulating
	workspace/tensor_data/my_project    # output of Formatting
	workspace/network/my_project        # output of Learning
	workspace/predict/my_project        # output of Predicting
	workspace/plot/my_project           # output of Plotting

.. _example_dataset:

Example dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``example`` project bundled with phyddle was generated using the command ``./code/run_pipeline.sh --cfg config --proj example --end_idx 25000``. This corresponds to a 3-region equal-rates GeoSSE model. All directories are populated, except ``raw_data/example`` contains only 20 original examples.


.. _analysis_config:

Analysis configuration
----------------------

There are two ways to configure a phyddle analysis: through the config file or (when run via command line) command line options. Settings a config file are overwritten by any provided command line options. Both input systems use the same names for the same settings. All required analysis settings must be provided by config file and command line options, together, for a phyddle analysis to run successfully.


.. _config_file:

Configuration by file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The config file is a Python dictionary that specifies various program settings (arguments or ``args``) that configure how the underlying pipeline steps behave. Because it's a Python script, you can write code within the config file to specify your analysis, if you find that helpful. The below example defines settings into different blocks based on which pipeline step first needs a given setting. However, any setting might be used by different pipeline steps, so we concatenate all settings into a single dictionary called ``args``, which is then used by all pipeline steps.

**NOTE: phyddle assumes you want to use the config file calle ``my_config.py``. Use a different config file by calling, e.g. ``./run_pipline --cfg my_other_config.py``**

.. _model_config:

Model Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Models in phyddle are designed by setting five control variables: ``model_type``, ``model_variant``, ``num_char``, ``rv_fn``, ``rv_arg``.

Defining a model is only needed if you use phyddle to simulate training data through the Simulating step. The Simulating step describes the format phyddle expects for training datasets.

At a high level, ``model_type`` defines a class of models that share similar statespaces and eventspaces. The ``model_variant`` defines how rates are assigned to distinct event patterns in the eventspace. The behavior of how characters evolve and how character states influence other evolutionary dynamics are internally determined by ``model_type`` and ``model_variant``. The number of distinct character supported by the model is set by ``num_char``. Lastly, the way base parameter values are drawn for each simulated example in the training dataset are controlled with a set of random variable functions (``rv_fn``) and random variable arguments (``rv_arg``). Both ``rv_fn`` and ``rv_arg`` are dictionaries with keys that correspond to event class labels. With ``rv_fn`` the values are data-generating functions that have arguments and behavior equivalent to ``scipy.stats.distribution.rvs``. With ``rv_arg`` the values are the arguments passed in to the corresponding ``rv_fn`` functions.

Descriptions of supported built-in models that you can specify with ``model_type`` and ``model_variant`` are listed using the ``--show_models``. (More models to come. Developer guide will describe how to add new back-end model variants \[easier\] and types \[harder\].)

.. code-block:: shell

	$ ./run_simulate.py --show_models
	Type                Variant             Description
	============================================================
	geosse              --                  Geographic State-dependent Speciation Extinction [GeoSSE]
						free_rates          rates differ among all events within type
						equal_rates         rates equal among all events within type
						density_effect      equal_rates + local density-dependent extinction

	sirm                --                  Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Migration [SIRM]
						free_rates          rates differ among all events within type
						equal_rates         rates equal among all events within type

Let's create a geographic state-dependent speciation-extinction (GeoSSE) model as a concrete example. GeoSSE models describe how species move and evolve among discrete regions through four event classes: within-region speciation, between-region speciation, dispersal, and local extinction. We'll create a GeoSSE model for a biogeographic system with three regions where all events within a class have equal rates, where rates are exponentially distributed with expected values of 1.0. The settings in the configuration file for this would be

.. code-block:: python

	'model_type'     : 'geosse',
	'model_variant'  : 'equal_rates',
	'num_char'       : 3,
	'rv_fn'          : {
			'w' : sp.stats.expon.rvs,
			'b' : sp.stats.expon.rvs,
			'd' : sp.stats.expon.rvs,
			'e' : sp.stats.expon.rvs
		},
	'rv_arg'         : {
			'w' : { 'scale' : 1.0 },
			'b' : { 'scale' : 1.0 },
			'd' : { 'scale' : 1.0 },
			'e' : { 'scale' : 1.0 }
		}


.. _pipeline_steps:

Pipeline steps
--------------

A phyddle pipeline analysis has five steps: Simulating, Formatting, Learning, Predicting, and Plotting.


.. _simulating_step:

Simulating Step
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your model is configured, you can instruct phyddle to simulate your training dataset. Currently, phyddle relies on the MASTER plugin from BEAST to simulate. MASTER was designed primarily to simulate under Susceptible-Infected-Recovered compartment models from epidemiology. These models allow for lineage to evolve according to rates that depend on the state of the entire evolutionary system. For example, the rate of change for one species may depend on its state and the number of other species in that state or other states. See the Requirements section to see how phyddle expects MASTER and BEAST are configured for its use.

Results from simulations are stored based on the ``sim_dir`` and ``proj`` settings. ``sim_dir`` is the directory in phyddle that contains the "raw" simulated output across all projects, and is typically set to ``raw_data``. ``proj`` defines the simulations for a single project. Each individual simulation is assigned a replicate index. You can simulate replicates in different "chunks" with the start (``start_idx``) and end (``end_idx``) index variables, which is especially useful for building up a training dataset for a project over multiple jobs, e.g. on a cluster.

Each replicate being simulated will run for some length of evolutionary time (``stop_time``) and may require some minimum (``min_num_taxa``) and/or maximum (``max_num_taxa``) number of lineages per simulation.

Assuming that ``sim_dir == raw_data`` and ``proj == example``, the standard simulation output will follow this format

.. code-block:: shell

	raw_data/example/sim.0.tre
	raw_data/example/sim.0.dat.nex
	raw_data/example/sim.0.param_col.csv
	raw_data/example/sim.0.param_row.csv


The ``.tre`` file contains a Newick string. The ``.dat.nex`` contains a Nexus character matrix. These are reformatted as tensors to become the input training dataset. The ``.param_col.csv`` and ``.param_row.csv`` contain the simulating parameters in column and row format, with the row format files being converted to a tensor of training labels. 

In addition, MASTER will retain only the certain simulated taxa (populations) from the system, set using ``sample_population``. phyddle generates an ``xml`` file that specifies the MASTER simulation, a ``beast.log`` file that reports the text generated by BEAST during simulation, and a ``json`` file that reports metadata about the evolutionary history of the system. These files can be valuable for debugging and postprocessing, but they may become quite large, so the ``sim_logging`` setting will control whether they are retained, compressed, or deleted.


Note, that downstream steps in the pipeline, such as Formatting, only require that the appropriate files with the appropriate content exist to proceed. They can either be generated with the Simuating step within phyddle or completely outside of phyddle.

.. _formatting_step:

Formatting Step
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Raw simulated data must first boverted into a tensor format to interface with the neural network we'll later train and use for future predictions. For most computational purposes, it is safe to think of a tensor as an n-dimensional array. It is essential that all individual datasets share a standard shape (e.g. numbers of rows and columns) to ensure the training dataset that contains predictable data patterns. phyddle formatting encodes two input tensors and one output tensor.

phyddle saves its formatted tensors to ``fmt_dir`` in a subdirectory called ``proj``. For example, if ``fmt_dir == tensor_data`` and ``proj == example`` then the tensors are stored in ``tensor_data/example``.

One input tensor is the **phylogenetic-state tensor**. Loosely speaking, these tensors contain information about terminal taxa across columns and information about relevant branch lengths and states per taxon across rows. The phylogenetic-state tensors used by phyddle are based on the compact bijective ladderized vector (CBLV) format of Voznica et al. (2022).

CBLV encodes a phylogenetic tree with $n \leq N$ taxa in to a matrix of with 2 rows that contains branch length sorted across $N$ columns that contain topological information for a tree with taxa serially sampled over time (e.g. epidemiological data). The matrix is then flattened into vector format. Ammon et al. (2022) introduced the CBLV+S format, which allows for multiple characters to be associated with each taxon in a CBLV, constructing a matrix with $2+M$ rows and $N$ columns for a dataset of $n \leq N$ taxa with $M$ characters. Another important tensor type developed by Lambert et al. (2022) is the compact diversified vector (CDV). CDV is a matrix with 2 rows and $N$ columns, with the first row corresponding to node ages and the other recording state values for a single binary character.

CBLV and CDV differ primarily in terms what criteria they use to they order (ladderize) the topology. CBLV ladderizes by minimum terminal-node age per clade and CDV ladderized by maximum subclade branch length. Both formats pack the phylogenetic information from a tree with $n$ taxa into a "wider" tree-width class that allows up to $N$ taxa. The tensor is packed from left-to-right based on an in-order tree traversal, then use zeroes to buffer the all remaining cells until the $N$th column. In phyddle, we use expanded CBLV+S and CDV+S formats that additionally encode terminal branch length formation for the terminal node and the parent node, resulting in $4+M$ rows for our CBLV+S and $3+M$ rows for our CDV+S format. (Will add diagram later.)

The second input is the **auxiliary data tensor**. This tensor contains summary statistics for the phylogeny and character data matrix and "known" parameters for the data generating process. The summary statistics, for example, report things such as the number of taxa, the tree height, the mean and variance of branch lengths and node ages, the state-pattern counts, etc. The known parameters might report things such as the population sizes of a susceptible population or the recovery period in an SIR model.

The output tensor reports **labels** that are generally unknown data generating parameters to be estimated using the neural network.  Depending on the estimation task, all or only some model parameters might be treated as labels for training and prediction. For example, when ``model_variant == 'free_rates'`` one might want to estimate every rate in the model, but estimate only one parameter per event-class when ``model_variant == 'equal_rates'``.

Formatting processes the tree, data matrix, and model parameters for each replicate. This is done in parallel, when the setting is enabled. Simulated data are processed using ``CBLV+S`` format if ``tree_type == 'serial'``. If ``tree_type = 'extant'`` then all non-extant taxa are pruned, saved as ``pruned.tre``, then encoded using CDV+S. The size of each tree ($n$) is then used to identify the largest value in ``tree_width_cats`` it can fit into. The phylogenetics-state tensors and auxiliary data tensors are then created. If ``save_phyenc_csv`` is set, then individual csv files are saved for each dataset, which is especially useful for formatting new empirical datasets into an accepted phyddle format. The ``param_pred`` setting identifies which parameters in the labels tensor you want to treat as downstream prediction targets. The ``param_data`` setting identifies which of those parameters you want to treat as "known" auxiliary data.

Formatted tensors are then saved to disk either in simple comma-separated value format or in a compressed HDF5 format. For example, suppose we set ``fmt_dir == 'tensor_data``, ``proj == 'example'``, and ``tree_type == 'serial'``. If we set, it produces ``tensor_format == 'hdf5'``:


.. code-block:: shell

	tensor_data/example/sim.nt200.hdf5
	tensor_data/example/sim.nt500.hdf5

or if ``tensor_format == 'csv'``:

.. code-block:: shell

	sim.nt200.cdvs.data.csv
	sim.nt200.labels.csv
	sim.nt200.summ_stat.csv
	sim.nt500.cdvs.data.csv
	sim.nt500.labels.csv
	sim.nt500.summ_stat.csv

These files can then be processed by the Learning step.


.. _learning_step:

Learning Step
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Learning builds a neural network that can be trained to make predictions based on the tensors made by the Formatting step. This step also shuffles the replicate indices and splits the entire dataset into separate training, test, validation, and calibration subsets. The phylogenetic-state tensor is processed by convolutional and pooling layers, while the auxiliary data is processed by dense layers. All input layers are concatenated then pushed into three branches terminating in output layers to produce point estimates and upper and lower prediction intervals. Lastly, the step runs the training procedure and stores its results, including the history and trained network, to file.

When data are read in, they are shuffled, with some set aside for test data (``prop_test``), validation data (``prop_validation``), and calibration data (``prop_calibration``), with the remaining data being used for ``training``. A network must be trained against a particular ``tree_width`` size (see above). The network also must target a particular prediction interval (e.g. ``cpi_coverage == 0.95`` means 95% of test predictions are expected contain the true simulating value) for two-sided conformalized quantile regression). Training runs for a number of intervals given by ``num_epoch`` using batch stochastic gradient descent, with batch sizes given by ``batch_size``. Parameter point estimates use a loss function (e.g. ``loss == 'mse'``; Tensorflow-supported string or function) while lower/upper prediction intervals must use a pinball loss function (hard-coded). Different optimizers can be used to update network weight and bias parameters (e.g. ``optimizer == 'adam'``; Tensorflow-supported string or function).

Training is automatically parallelized using CPUs and GPUs, dependent on how Tensorflow was installed and system hardware. Output files are stored in the directory assigned to ``<lrn_dir>`` in the subdirectory ``<proj>``.


.. _predicting_step:

Predicting Step
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
### Predicting

Predicting loads a new dataset stored in ``<pred_dir>/<proj>`` with filenames ``<pred_prefix.tre>`` and ``<pred_prefix>.dat.nex``. This step then loads a pretrained network and has it predict new point estimates and calibrated prediction intervals based on other project settings. New predictions are then stored into the original ``<pred_dir>/<proj>``.


.. _plotting_step:

Plotting Step
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plotting collects all results from the Formatting, Learning, and Predicting steps to compile a set of useful figures, listed below. When a prediction is available, the step will integrate it into other figures to contextualize where that input dataset and predicted labels fall with respect to the training dataset. Plots are stored within ``<plot_dir>`` in the ``<proj>`` subdirectory. Colors for plot elements can be modified with ``plot_train_color``, ``plot_label_color``, ``plot_test_color``, ``plot_val_color``, ``plot_aux_color``, and ``plot_pred_color`` using common color names or hex codes supported by Matplotlib.

- ``summary.pdf`` contains all figures in a single plot
- ``pred_est_CI.pdf`` - simple plot of point estimates and calibrated prediction intervals for prediction
- ``histogram_aux.pdf`` - histograms of all values in the auxiliary dataset; red line for predicted dataset
