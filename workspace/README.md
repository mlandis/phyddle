- `levy_r`           : Levy model (R, pulsR)
- `geosse_revbayes`  : GeoSSE model (RevBayes)
- `bisse_timehet_pj` : Time-heterogeneous BiSSE model (Python, PhyloJunction)
- `bdk_master`       : Birth-death model with density-dependent extinction (Python, MASTER, masterpy)
- `sir_master`       : SIR model (MASTER and masterpy)
- `sirm_master/exponential_phase`  : SIR + Migration model, sample only during early outbreak (Python, MASTER, masterpy)
- `sirm_master/all_phases`         : SIR + Migration model, sample throughout outbreak  (Python, MASTER, masterpy)
